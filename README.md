# Calorie_burnt_prediction-Project
- Developed a machine learning model using XGBoost regression algorithm to predict calories burnt with an R-squared accuracy of 
  0.99.
- Used datasets from Kaggle, merging and preprocessing calories and exercise data for model training.
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.48 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.71.
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets for effective model validation.
